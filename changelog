    Added a new writeController and datsource to the api. Additionally, added user_generated
    versions to each of the entities in this thing. Comments are few and far between,
    and none of this went down particularly easily.

    Things to look into:
        Are we sure there's no way to make another schema recognizible? I followed
        the supabase tutorial for making and publishing a schema but none of it worked.
        They were never actually reachable.

        Desparate to make anything even remotely work, I commented out a bunch of "transformers"
        in the /src/datasources/entities/ligand.ts file. It's probably important but I'm mad rn 
        and don't want to put it back in.

        The endpoint works right now, even if it doesn't do anyting particularly helpful.
